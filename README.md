# ScoreScraper
Project uses data from theScore.com to construct an up-to-date list of sports matchups for any given date. The data that is collected includes the teams participating in the event and the score of the match as well as the way in which the match concluded if the game has previously completed. If the game is still yet to be played on the given date of the user, then a list of betting odds will be updated instead of the score of the game.
The project then formats this data into an excel-readable .csv file.
