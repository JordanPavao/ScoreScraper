# ScoreScraper
Project uses data from theScore.com to construct an up-to-date list of sports matchups for any given date. The data that is collected includes the teams participating in the event as well as the score of the match along with the way in which the match concluded. If the game is still yet to be played on the date that the user has selected, then a list of betting odds will be included rather than the score of the game.
The project then formats this data into an excel-readable .csv file.
